            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>My father's name is Mr. Steven, and he is 47 years old. He is self-employed and his wife, which is my mother, Madam Helen is 45 years old, and she works for my father's company as a manager. They have been married for 22 years and blessed with 4 children. The eldest child is my sister Neydine, who is 21 years old and is presently pursuing a bachelor's degree in marketing at UiTM Kota Kinabalu. The second daughter is Sylvia which is me and I'm 20 years old and currently pursuing my study at UiTM Campus Samarahan. The third child is my little sister, she is 14 years old and a student at SMK Bandaraya Kota Kinabalu.The last child of the family is the youngest son, Jerico which is 10 years old and enrolled in Grade 4 at Sekolah Rendah Swasta (SRS) Simon Fung.</p>
            <p>We reside in Taman Rimbunan Hijau, our own residence, in Kota Kinabalu. In addition, both my parents have their own vehicles. My father purchased his Toyota Unser so that it would be suitable for extended road trips and also serve as a family vehicle. My mother owns a Toyota Fortuner, and my older sister uses the Toyota Innova to go to university.</p>
